  title={Shapley chains: Extending Shapley values to Classifier chains},
  author={Ayad, Célia Wafa and Bonnier, Thomas and Bosch, Benjamin and Read, Jesse},
  abstract={In spite of increased attention on explainable machine learning models, explaining multi-output predictions has not yet been extensively addressed. Methods that use Shapley values to attribute feature contributions to the decision making are one of the most popular approaches to explain local individual and global predictions. By considering each output separately in multi-output tasks, these methods fail to provide complete feature explanations. We propose Shapley chains to overcome this issue by including label interdependencies in the explanation design process. Shapley chains assign Shapley values as feature importance scores in multi-output classification using classifier chains, by separating the direct and indirect influence of these feature scores. Compared to existing methods, this approach allows to attribute a more complete feature contribution to the predictions of multi-output classification tasks. We provide a mechanism to distribute the hidden contributions of the outputs with respect to a given chaining order of these outputs. Moreover, we show how our approach can reveal indirect feature contributions missed by existing approaches. Shapley chains help to emphasize the real learning factors in multi-output applications and allows a better understanding of the flow of information through output interdependencies in synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
